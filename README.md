Battleship
--
This is a classic battleship game that developed in Unity with C# as programming language. Aim of this project is to improve my knowledge and ability on Unity, networking and mobile technologies. Game will be developed as an open source project to let other people benefit who wants to learn or improve things related to this project.

I hope to publish the game on Google Play Store for Android phones to have a public executable if the final result satisfies me. Since some keys or addresses are private (about database and networking) I may not be able to share everything. I might hide a file that saves those private things as constants or find template accounts for this. I don't have a strict idea but I'll try to exhibit as much as I can.

A rough plan of the development and further informations can be found on this Trello board: https://trello.com/b/7HvgfiWf/battleship
